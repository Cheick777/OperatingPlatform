Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? 

The client is the company called Gaming Room. Gaming room is mobile app creator and the game that they try to improve is called Draw It or Lost It for Android. The client which is The Gaming Room  desired to create a web-based version of its existing Android app in order to make the game available on multiple platforms and devices. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?  

What I particularly did to develop this documentation was to trying to keep this document simple, clear and understandable as much as I could in order the client can understand.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?  
The designing documentation was helpful when I was developing code, It helps focus on the project, see clear vision on where you are going and helps decide which tasks are more important and which don't require your time or attention and helps decide on the cost. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?  
If I have to choose one part of my work on these documentation to revise, I would choose the evaluation part. I feel they’re lot to learn and comprehend in that section because it is all about Mac, windows, linux and mobile platform like android and IOS. To improve these I will go deeper in searching lot of more information put them in simpler way so that clients can understand and see themself like developer.  I will spend more time on client side and users because it really all about them. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?  
To interpret users needs and implement them into your software design can be difficult sometimes because It all depends on users, users is the final customers of the product. Your client may have asked you to do the work, but the product is truly controlled by the users. If they do not trust the software or have problems with it, they will not use it and will not purchase any additional products.  Usually the users complain about how fast software response and how beautiful the design look. But I will make sure all the functionalities work fine and fast. If the product is slow users will not like it and they will probably not buy it.


How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?  

I think  good system to design is organizing program modules in a way that makes them easy to develop and change. Also I will structure the design techniques to assist programmers in dealing with program size and complexity.  I will Analyze and write instructions for developers on how to write code and how to put pieces of code together to form a program.  I put my focus on clear documentation and separating game and game needs functionality to allow easier updates and maintenance. To allow for easier updates and maintenance, I focused on clear documentation and separating game and game needs functionality.
